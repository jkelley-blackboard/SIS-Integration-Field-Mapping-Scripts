# The sample XML files in this repository are provided in two formats:

- Uploadable XML – files that are correctly structured and can be manually uploaded into Blackboard for testing and validation.
- Guidance-only XML – files included as examples to demonstrate configuration patterns. These are not in a directly uploadable form and must be adapted before use.
